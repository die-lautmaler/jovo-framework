## Introduction

[NLP.js](https://github.com/axa-group/nlp.js) is an open source [natural language understanding (NLU)](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/tag/nlu) library with features like entity extraction, sentiment analysis, and language detection.

Since it is an open source service, you can host NLP.js on your own servers without any external API calls.

You can use the Jovo NLP.js integration for projects where you receive raw text input that needs to be translated into structured meaning to work with the Jovo intent structure. Patforms like the [Jovo Core Platform](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-platform-core) (e.g. in conjunction with the [Jovo Web Client](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-client-web)), [Facebook Messenger](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-platform-facebookmessenger), and [Google Business Messages](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-platform-googlebusiness) are some examples where this would work.

Smaller NLP.js language models are fast to train and can even be used on serverless infrastructure like [AWS Lambda](https://www.jovo.tech/docs/hosting/aws-lambda) without having to use any additional server infrastructure. We recommend taking a close look at the execution times though, as larger models can take quite some time to build.

## Installation

You can install the plugin like this:

```sh
$ npm install @jovotech/nlu-nlpjs
```

NLU plugins can be added to Jovo platform integrations. Here is an example how it can be added to the Jovo Core Platform in `app.ts`:

```typescript
import { CorePlatform } from '@jovotech/platform-core';
import { NlpjsNlu } from '@jovotech/nlu-nlpjs';

// ...

app.configure({
  plugins: [
    new CorePlatform({
      plugins: [new NlpjsNlu()],
    }),
    // ...
  ],
});
```

## Configuration

The following configurations can be added:

```typescript
new NlpjsNlu({
  languageMap: { /* ... */ },
  preTrainedModelFilePath: './model.nlp',
  useModel: false,
  modelsPath: './models',
  setupModelCallback: (platform: Platform, nlpjs) => { /* ... */ },
}),
```

- `languageMap`: An object where the key represents a language, and the value is a language-package of NLP.js. By default, it is an empty object.
- `useModel` and `preTrainedModelFilePath`: NLP.js can take a pretrained model if `useModel` is set to `true`. It looks for the model in the `preTrainedModelFilePath`. The default is `./model.nlp`.
- `setupModelCallback`: A function that can be passed to set up NLP.js. The first parameter is the current `Platform` and the second parameter is the `Nlp`-instance of NLP.js.

Depending on the configuration, NlpjsNlu will try to use the `setupModelCallback` if it exists.
Otherwise, the integration will check if `useModel` is set to `true`, if that's the case, the model is getting loaded from `preTrainedModelFilePath`.
If `setupModellCallback` does not exist and `useModel` is falsy, the integration will attempt to build a model based on the local models and train it.

## Jovo Model

You can use the [Jovo Model](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-model) to turn the language model files in your `models` folder into an NLP.js model. [Learn more about the NLP.js Jovo Model integration here](https://www.jovo.tech/marketplace/jovo-model/nlpjs).
