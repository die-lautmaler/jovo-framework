## Introduction

The Jovo context object (also referenced as `this`) includes many properties that are instantiated with each request.

In the `this` context, you can access them like this:

```typescript
this.$propertyName

// Example: $request
this.$request
```

The properties can be grouped into [RIDR](#ridr-properties), [input](#input), and [context properties](#context-properties).

## RIDR Properties

Jovo app execution follows the [RIDR lifecycle](./ridr-lifecycle.md) that includes four steps: request, interpretation, dialogue & logic, response.

Each of the steps result in a Jovo property: [`$request`](#request), [`$input`](#input), [`$output`](#output), [`$response`](#response).

### $request

The `$request` property contains all information about a request. It is the result of the first step of the [RIDR lifecycle](./ridr-lifecycle.md).

```typescript
this.$request
```

### $input

The `$input` property contains structured data that is derived from a request. For example, speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) data. It is the result of the second step of the [RIDR lifecycle](./ridr-lifecycle.md).

```typescript
this.$input
```

[Learn more about the `$input` property here](./input.md).

### $output

The `$output` property contains structured output that is later turned into a native platform response. It is the result of executing a [handler](./handlers.md) and the third step of the [RIDR lifecycle](./ridr-lifecycle.md).

```typescript
this.$output
```

[Learn more about the `$output` property here](./output.md).


### $response

The `$response` property contains the native response that gets sent back to the platform. It is the result of the fourth step of the [RIDR lifecycle](./ridr-lifecycle.md).

```typescript
this.$response
```

## Input Properties

Alongside [`$input`](#input), there are additional properties that contain interpreted information about the user's request.

The properties include [`$entities`](#entities) and [`$route`](#route).

### $entities

The `$entities` property contains entities as part of the [structured input](#input).

```typescript
this.$entities
```

### $route

The `$route` property is the result of the [routing process](./routing.md).

```typescript
this.$route
```

[Learn more about routing here](./routing.md).

## Context Properties

Context properties contain information that was not explicitly stated by the user, but rather information accompanying the request.

The properties include [`$data`](#data), [`$session`](#session), [`$user`](#user), [`$device`](#device), and [`$history`](#history).

### $data

The `$data` property allows you to store data for the current request.

```typescript
this.$data
```

[Learn more about request data here](./data.md#request-data).

### $session

The `$session` property contains data and features about the current session.

```typescript
this.$session
```

One of the most used features of `$session` is to write and access session data:

```typescript
this.$session.data.key = value;
```

[Learn more about session data here](./data.md#session-data).

### $state

The `$state` property is the state stack that gets built as part of the [routing and state management](./routing.md).

```typescript
this.$state
```

[Learn more about the `$state` stack here](./state-stack.md).

### $user

The `$user` property contains data and features about the specific user interacting with the app.

```typescript
this.$user
```

One of the most used features of `$user` is to write and access data that is persisted in a user database:

```typescript
this.$user.data.key = value;
```

[Learn more user data here](./data.md#user-data).

### $device

The `$device` property contains data and features about the specific device the user is interacting with.

```typescript
this.$device
```

[Learn more about the `$device` property here](./device.md).


### $history

The `$history` property contains data and features 

```typescript
this.$history
```

[Learn more about the `$history` property here](./data.md#history).
